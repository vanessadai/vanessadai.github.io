<h3 id="What-are-my-research-target-and-research-method"><a href="#What-are-my-research-target-and-research-method" class="headerlink" title="What are my research target and research method?"></a>What are my research target and research method?</h3><p>I once read an article called “The Symbolic Racism 2000 Scale” published by P.J. Henry and David O.Sears. In this article, the author defines the term “racial resentment” and illustrates different terms of the symbolic racism in the US history. I not only understand the seriousness of social issues like racial discrimination, but I am inspired to find out more facts about it. Indeed, this article on racial discrimination in the US motivated me to start this research.</p>
<p>My research target is to analyze the dynamic change of racial resentment in terms of two factors——state and timeline. To be specific, I hope to quantify both the comparative relationship related to racial resentment in each state in specific years and study their racial resentment changes in the past two decades for each state. On top of that, I am able to study the trends inside states with the most serious situation over time at the US national level. </p>
<p>In this project, I was first given census and individual opinion data. Then, I studied the primitive data and tried to find the probable relationships between the level of racial resentment and relevant demographic factors, such as age group, race, gender etc. in the data examples. By using the method of MRP (Multi-level Regression Post-stratification), I got the prediction of average racial resentment index for each state by combining the small group of individual opinion data with huge census data. After a series of data processing, finally I got the score of two-dimensional matrix with 50 states and 9 specific years, covering from 1988 to 2016.<br>When all the data processing is completed, I use R language to make plots which signify the extent of racial resentment in each state in certain years.</p>

How did I overcome it?"></a>What was the biggest challenge that I encountered? How did I overcome it?</h3><p>To me, the biggest challenge is the utilization of different tools when analyzing the data. For example, as lacking the sufficient knowledge of mathematical statistics, I could not understand the methodology of the political science analysis very clearly at the beginning of this project. Sometimes I failed to organize my logic chain.<br>Moreover, this is my first time to learn the R language, so I was not familiar with some of the algorithm at first. In this process, I tried to overcome such difficulties by practice. I seek help from some computer engineers for the basic knowledge of R language, and I searched a lot of information online, read some essays written by professors in this area and turned to my teachers for help. In the end, I was able to use different ways to run the sentence.  </p>

(Optional)"></a>What was the most interesting part of my project? (Optional)</h3><p>The most interesting part of this project is that I am able to use quantitative analysis to examine the extent of racial resentment in different individuals who represent their own states. This process of turning survey data into colorful graphs inspires my willingness to investigate further into such problems. When I got to see the graphics change at last, I was not only shocked, but I also realized that I had a deeper understanding of the issue of racial discrimination in different states of the US. In the end, I was aware that we should not only see this as a fixed and constant concept, but what we need to know is the dynamic change of such phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="What-are-my-research-result-s-and-conclusion-s"><a href="#What-are-my-research-result-s-and-conclusion-s" class="headerlink" title="What are my research result(s) and conclusion(s)?"></a>What are my research result(s) and conclusion(s)?</h3><p>The result and conclusion in this study is very innovative and interesting. We tend to believe that the southern states in the US have much more serious racial resentment than the northern states. Perhaps there is an element of truth in this normal conception because of many factors like slavery in the past century. In this study, however, when I was making the plots where darker area represented more serious racial discrimination, I found an interesting phenomena. In fact, from the year 1988 to 2016, southern states showed a declining trend of racial resentment while northern states showed an inclining trend of racial resentment. Examples of northern states like North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and Maine can perfectly illustrate this point. In the year of 1988, last four states are all colored with light blue area which signifies the extent of 30% to 40% percentile and this totally matched our normal perspective of “less racial discrimination” in the northern states. However, in the following years from 1990 to 2012, as it is shown on the graph, the colors of these states are obviously darkened to approximately 50% to 60% percentile. Finally, in 2016, the extent of racial resentment in all of these 5 states hit a new peak to almost 70% percentile and North Dakota even reaches 80%, which is one of the darkest area in this graph. Meanwhile, if we look at the graphic change of southern states, we will find that some of the states like Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia indeed show a decline trend of racial resentment from 80 percentile to 50 percentile between the year 1988 and 2016 even though such declination and covered states are small.</p>
